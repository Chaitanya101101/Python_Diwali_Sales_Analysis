# Python-Diwali Sales Analysis Project

### Objective: Python project to analyze diwali sales data
Implement a Python project to analyze Diwali sales data, focusing on strategies to improve customer experience, maximize revenue and increase sales during the festive season.

### Dataset used:
<a href="https://github.com/Chaitanya101101/Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Diwali%20Sales%20Data.csv">Diwali Sales Data</a>

### Procedure(Steps Involved):
- **Data Collection:**
Imported the csv file data provided by the customer using the pandas library in Python.
- **Data Cleaning:**
Performed data cleaning operations, including the removal of null values, blank columns from the dataset and changed data types, also applied various methods available in the pandas library.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
In order to gain insights from the data, we conducted exploratory data analysis. This involved creating visual representations such as barplot and countplot using the seaborn and matplotlib libraries in Python.

### Result:
I have analyzed Diwali sales data using popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python. The dataset was processed by removing irrelevant columns, null value checks, and exploratory data analysis. Trends and patterns in the sales data were identified to gain insights into consumer preferences, popular products, and sales performance. The project visualizes customer count and total amount spent by gender, the relationship between total amount spent and age group, total orders and amount spent by the top 10 states, and the top 10 most sold products. This project showcased a strong understanding of data analysis skills, Python proficiency, and the ability to derive valuable insights for informed business decisions.

### Project Learning:
- Performed data cleaning and manipulation.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
- Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.
- Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.

### Conclusion:
Married women of age group 26â€“35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.
